# Solana-Assignments-by-Rise-in

This repository contains my solutions to assignments and projects related to Solana development using Rust. The assignments are part of my learning journey in blockchain development and specifically in building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana blockchain.


# Getting Started
To run the assignments locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.

Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Rust).

Navigate to the specific assignment directory.

Run the application using the appropriate commands:

    cd specific-assignment
    
    cargo build
    
    cargo test -- --nocapture
    
    or cargo test
